# Power BI Visualization for Azure Synapse SQL Pool Database Management Views

This repo provides Power BI Desktop template that can be used to visualize Azure Synapse DMVs. DMVs provide more insights into the internals of Azure Synapse Pools. This helps to better understand the performance problems, tune distribution and understand overall performance of the database. 

The template connects to more than 30 DMVs and Azure Monitor metrics. The template provides some baseline visuals which can be extended further. 


Here are some of the visualization that can be created.
